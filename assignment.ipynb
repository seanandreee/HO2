    "# Hands-On Assignment 2\n",
    "\n",
    "As we saw in Module 2, machine learning is about optimizing over a loss.\n",
    "How well a machine learning model performs depends on both the hypothesis and loss function that we choose to use.\n",
    "This general framework goes under the name of *[empirical risk minimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_risk_minimization)*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, we will walk you through the basic steps of empirical risk minimization: the optimization problem at the heart of most modern-day machine learning systems.\n",
    "We will use a simple motivating example for an end-to-end demonstration: predicting whether a patient with a given antigen test value is infected with Covid-19.\n",
    "Using the same synthetic Covid-19 dataset you worked with in Hands-On Assignment 1,\n",
    "we will train a simple [classifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_classification)\n",
    "which predicts that an individual is infected with Covid-19 if and only if their test value is above a certain threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "After that, we will take a break from the serious stuff and learn about regular expression\n",
    "(or review regular expressions if you are already familiar).\n",
    "Regular expressions are a tool that you will almost certainly find useful for your entire CS career,\n",
    "and is especially useful when working with data (as you will be doing a lot).\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment is divided into four parts:\n",
    "1. We will first set up a basic empirical risk minimization problem.\n",
    "2. Next, we will find a hypothesis that results in a small loss.\n",
    "3. Then, we will evaluate our solution and the associated risks of deployment.\n",
    "4. Finally, we will learn about all the core features of regular expressions."

    "## Part 1: Setting up the Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part we will setup the empirical risk minimization problem we wish to solve, by:\n",
    " - Defining our variables of interest.\n",
    " - Choosing a \"hypothesis class\" $ \\mathcal{H} $, or space of possible solutions, that we will search.\n",
    " - Selecting a \"loss function\" $ L $ that will be minimized by our learned solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Empirical Risk Minimization - The Big Picture\n",
    "\n",
    "Empirical risk minimization is about trying to come up with a function (usually called a *hypothesis*) that can make correct predictions as often as possible.\n",
    "The more our hypothesis is correct, the lower the *risk* of that hypothesis.\n",
    "A hypothesis that is always correct has zero risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "But in real life, it's almost always impossible to make something that is always correct.\n",
    "(If we could, there would be no point in machine learning.)\n",
    "It's also impossible for us to always know when our hypothesis is right or wrong\n",
    "(imagine trying to predict something for every person in the world (past, present, and future)).\n",
    "We may know how our hypothesis performs on our small dataset,\n",
    "but we can't know how it will perform on all possible data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "So since we can't compute the true risk of a hypothesis, we instead approximate it by computing an *empirical risk*.\n",
    "To do this, we narrow down our set of data points from every possible data point to a known set of data (called our \"training data\").\n",
    "We can then compute our average loss over our training data to compute our empirical risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Empirical Risk Minimization - Mathematical Formalism\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's put our intuition from the previous section into math.\n",
    "\n",
    "Empirical risk minimization is the **minimization** (over several possible hypotheses $ \\mathcal{H} $) of the expected loss (i.e. *risk*) of a hypothesis $ h $ with the data $ Z $:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\min_{h \\in \\mathcal{H}} \\mathbb{E}_Z \\Big[ L(Z, h) \\Big]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "So we want to select one hypothesis $ h $ from our set of possible hypotheses $ \\mathcal{H} $\n",
    "that minimizes the loss (risk) we expect to achieve.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we are taking the [expectation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value) ($ \\mathbb{E} $) over all possible values of the data.\n",
    "If you haven’t seen expectation before, we will discuss it in detail in a future module.\n",
    "But for now, you can think of expectation as the average value we would get if we randomly sampled infinite data points.\n",
    "For example, if we fairly picked random numbers between 1 and 99 (inclusive),\n",
    "then the expected value (expectation) would be 50.\n",
    "You can make a small Python program to try it out yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using our training data $ Z = \\{z_1, z_2, z_3, ..., z_N \\} $, we can say that:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbb{E}_{Z} \\Big[ L(Z, h) \\Big] \\approx \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i = 1}^N L(z_i, h)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This may look intimidating,\n",
    "but remember that $ L(z_i, h) $ is just a function that produces a single number.\n",
    "So if we say that our loss for the ith data point is $ L(z_i, h) = l_i $,\n",
    "then our equation looks like:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbb{E}_{Z} \\Big[ l \\Big] \\approx \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i = 1}^N l_i\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Which we can see is just an average.\n",
    "So the key takeaway here is that the expectation is just an average over possible outcomes\n",
    "(in this case each data point is one possible outcome)."

    "In this part, we will learn how to evaluate our solution and consider the associated risks of deployment.\n",
    "In general, each of the steps we went through in previous parts are non-trivial and raises questions that are the subject of active research.\n",
    "For example:\n",
    " - Is our selection of variables appropriate, or do they induce bias in our predictor?\n",
    " - What loss functions naturally encode our objectives? Which have mathematical advantages? Which introduce systematic risks?\n",
    " - What algorithms are effective in which settings, and what theoretical results can we prove regarding speed, efficiency, or safety?\n",
    " - How do we use existing data effectively, again without introducing bias or systemic errors in our solutions?\n",
    " - Can our algorithms scale to larger datasets?\n",
    " - Can we choose algorithms that can guarantee our results are good enough?\n",
    "\n",
    "While we have found the threshold titer value that minimizes Zero-One loss and therefore maximizes accuracy,\n",
    "accuracy (especially evaluated only on the data used for training) is not necessarily the best quantity to optimize.\n",
    "For example, our Covid-19 data only has about 5% of patients that are infected.\n",
    "Predicting False for all data points would give an accuracy of 95%.\n",
    "The accuracy may be high, but the predictor is useless.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, sometimes we care about certain types of errors more than others.\n",
    "Consider the following use for our titer-threshold classifier: we wish to screen visitors for entry to a ward of immunocompromised patients.\n",
    "If our classifier makes a mistake, we would rather it error on the side of caution and predict that someone has Covid-19 when they actually do not.\n",
    "This way even if we made an error, we protected the immunocompromised patients.\n",
    "In this example, optimizing for accuracy alone is not the best measure of utility.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Binary Classification Errors\n",
